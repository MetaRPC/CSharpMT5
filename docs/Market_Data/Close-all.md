# Close All (`close-all`) üßπ

## What it Does üéØ

Closes **all open positions** on the current MT5 account in one go.
Useful for emergency flattening, end-of-session cleanup, or switching strategies.

> *If your implementation supports filters (e.g., by symbol/side/magic), use them to limit what gets closed. Otherwise it closes **everything** that‚Äôs open.*

## When to Use ‚ùì

* **Emergency flatten** ‚Äî flatten exposure quickly.
* **End-of-day** ‚Äî exit everything before market close.
* **Strategy switch** ‚Äî clear previous positions prior to deployment.

---

## Notes & Safety üõ°Ô∏è

* Consider slippage (`deviation`) defaults used internally by your close calls.
* If server rejects some closes (e.g., trading disabled, market closed), the result should report per-ticket errors.
* In `--dry-run` mode nothing is sent; use it to confirm filters and scope.
